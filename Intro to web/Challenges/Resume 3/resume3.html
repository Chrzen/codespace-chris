      <h1>Chris Oosthuizen</h1>
      <p> I'm a curious person by nature, enjoy solving problems, and discovering patterns. Currently I works as a data scientist, which involves a lot of development an modeling. When I'm AFK, you will typically find me climbing a rock face somewhere outdoors. </p>

          <h3> Bachelor of Engineering - BE, Civil Engineering (2013-2018) </h3>
            <p>Civil engineering is the development of infrastructure, effecting every sphere of the modern society. This ranges from water resource development and management, transport planning and road construction, design of large buildings and bridges, the interaction between structures and the earth, as well as all aspects of construction management. The civil engineer plays a pivotal role in society and has the opportunity to improve the everyday lives of people! Main focus area on structural analysis and informatics. For my final year project I modeled Conceret Hollow Sections (CHS) with the help of a simple Multi-layered Perceptron (MLP)</p>
            
            <h3> Master of Engineering - MEng, Industrial Engineering (2020-2022) </h3>
            <p> ata science is the scientific investigation that employs innovative approaches and algorithms, most notably machine learning algorithms, for processing and analysing data. Data Science technologies can be applied to both small and big data, of various types such as relational, images, video, audio, and text. Big data constitutes extremely large data sets that may be analysed computationally to reveal patterns, trends and associations, especially relating to human behaviour and interactions. The data science programmes focus on enabling students to develop innovative optimisation and machine learning techniques to produce novel, efficient and robust data science technologies, for use in Industrial Engineering, Engineering Management and related applications. Examples include forecasting, customer segmentation and targeted marketing, production quality control, supply chair performance prediction and process monitoring. My dissertation was on modeling conflict in Afghanistan with long short-term memory (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks). LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network capable of learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems) </p>
